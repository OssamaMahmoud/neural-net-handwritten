Application to recognize handwritten digits with a neural net based on the MINST handwritten digit data set. 
Various machine learning algorithms applied to create a Matlab application to label handwritten digits

Algorithms examined: 
Linear Perceptron 
KNN classifier (best k = 3) 
Neural Net (1 layer with 100 nodes)
Validated Hyperparameter Neural Net (2 layers with 140 nodes in the first layer and 70 in the second, regression parameter = 0.9) 

Test Error Set results: 
Linear Perceptron: 0.1725
KNN classifier:  0.0790
Neural Net: 0.0915
Validated Neural Net: 0.0795


Note training at initial start of program does take some time. 
GUI is based on the GUI made by Dr. Olga Veksler
